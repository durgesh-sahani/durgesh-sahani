### Hi there üëã

Myself Durgesh Sahani from India, currently living my life one of the best city of India, PUNE. Being an M.Sc. (Information Technology) with 10+ years of vivid experience as a software developer possess in-depth knowledge of web technologies.

I love to learn and understand new technologies and create a video tutorials for YouTube.

I remember how I participated in my college to teach my juniors on occasion of Teachers Day, and own the 1st prize which developed my interest in teaching. After that I started my own Institute ‚ÄúTREE INSTITUTE OF SOFTWARE TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT‚Äù and run the same successfully for two years.

Then I was thinking to switch into development and moved to PUNE, soon become a part of MNC and gain some practical knowledge of software development but still I was missing teaching so started my YouTube channel learnWebCoding which got 20K+ subscribers now.

Recently, I was also got Alumni Meet invite from my college as a chief guest to mentor junior students.

Pandemic changed my mind about education system, I designed kids E-Learning platform initially for my daughter but now made it public as its have really cool features like voice reading, letter and number writing, patterns, puzzles, GK, math, drawings, etc. Check is out https://baalvidya.in

My daughter learn a lot from it everything is available in a single place and in multi languages. Hence we don't need to worry about her revisions, BaalVidya can do that for us. Finally we decided to do homeschooling for her and so far this is going really well.

Even, I motivated my wife to start her cooking YouTube channel. She got 300+ videos and 8K+ subscribers and started earning through Google Adsense. Check it out her amazing testy recipes https://youtube.com/ChatpatiRasoee
